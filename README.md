jQuery-ColumnView
=================

A simple script to transform a hierarchical HTML list into a Miller
Column UI (AKA, Mac OS X Finder style, NeXT style column view).

Compatibility
-------------

The latest version of Columnview now supports jQuery version 1.2.x,
1.3.x and 1.4.x. Additionally, keyboard navigation is now available on
all browsers when using jQuery 1.3 or later. The Livequery plugin is
no longer required, but keyboard navigation is not supported with
jQuery 1.2 (at the moment).

The plugin works fine with jQuery 1.6.2.

Usage
-----

See demo.html for examples of usage.
